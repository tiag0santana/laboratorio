Although we use the concept of sequential blind extraction of sources and independent component analysis, we do not carry out the extraction in a completely blind manner; neither do we assume that sources are statistically independent. In fact, we show that the a priori information about the autocorrelation function of primary sources can be used to extract the desired signals (sources of interest) from their linear mixtures. Extensive computer simulations and real data application experiments confirm the validity and high performance of the proposed algorithm.">

In this work, a scaled Fourier linear combiner (SFLC) event-related to the R-R interval of ECG is proposed. It estimates the deterministic component of the impedance cardiographic signal and removes the noises uncorrelated to this interval. The impedance cardiographic signal is modeled as Fourier series with the coefficients estimated by the least mean square (LMS) algorithm. Simulations have been carried out to evaluate the filter performance for different noise conditions. Moreover, the method capability to remove uncorrelated noises was also examined in physiological data obtained in rest and exercise, by synchronizing respiration and pedaling with a metronome. Analyzing the ICG power spectrum, it was concluded that the proposed filter could remove the noises that are not synchronized with heart rate.">

This work presents an alternative method based upon of independent components analysis (ICA) to localize the distance at which singlephase, two-phase, two-phase grounding and three-phase faults occur in a 500 kV transmission systems starting from different angles of fault incidence at different distances along the line together with fault signals or traveling waves subject to other perturbations unrelated with the desired fault signal at the fault distance placement. Simulations results of a 500 kV high voltage transmission system got with the software Alternative transients program (ATP) show that the proposed methodology implemented with Matlab is a rather efficient tool for various fault types location.">
